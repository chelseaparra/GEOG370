    <h1>Homework 10: Vector Spatial Analysis</h1>

    <p>For my map, I was interested in looking at fault lines and 
        how human structures interact with them. We'd talked about 
        areas with historic faults lines and potenial hazards that
        come from building near them in one of my geology classes.
        This inspired me to look into fault lines in western North
        Carolina and what structures are built on these fault lines. 
        To do this I used a shapefile containing the geologic fault
        lines for North Carolina and placed it over a NC counties
        layer. Then I found data for bridges managed by the NC Department
        of Transportation and added the points to my map. Then I
        created a buffer of 30 meters on the fault lines. I chose
        a buffer of 30 meters because it is the reccommended minimum
        distance to build from a fault line. Then using the intersect
        funtion I found all the bridge points that intersect the buffer.
        Then to clean up the map I removed the points that didn't
        intersect the fault lines. The buffer and intersect function
        shows that many bridges are built on fault lines in western North
        Carolina. However, historic faults in North Carolina are fairly
        inactive so the risk to these structures is fairly minimal.
