    <h1>Homework 9: Make a Choropleth or Proportional Symbol Map</h1>

    <h2>Chelsea Parra</h2>
    <p>For my choropleth I chose to continue to work with data related
        to Texas. I was generally interested in average water usage by the 
        counties but decided to be more specific. This choropleth shows
        freshwater usage by livestock in each Texas county. I knew that 
        Texas had a good amount of cattle farming so I expected to see areas
        with high water uasage, however I did not know where in Texas these
        areas would be. It seems that the northwest portion of Texas and parts
        of east Texas use higher amounts of freshwater. After looking up other 
        data to explain this pattern, I found that these higher usage areas do
        in fact have higher numbers of livestock.
