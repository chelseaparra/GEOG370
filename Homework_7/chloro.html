    <h1>Homework 7: Census Data Choropleth</h1>

    <h2>Chelsea Parra</h2>
    <p>For my choropleth I chose to look at the total population of each county that are enrolled in college
        or graduate school. Looking at the counties, very few have a population that is enrolled in college or graduate 
        school greater than 29,000. This was honeslty surprising to me, I expected a state with so many colleges to have more of
        its population enrolled in them. The county with the largest population enrolled in college or graduate school is Harris
        County. This is the county that Houston is in which not only has a larger population, but also hosts three major univeristies.
        These include Rice Univeristy, Texas Southern Univeristy, and University of Houston.</p>
