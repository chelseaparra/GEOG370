    <h1>Homework 8: Census Data Ratios and Categories</h1>

    <h2>Chelsea Parra</h2>
    <p>In order to normalize my data, I created a ratio using the total population of people
        attending college or graduate school in each county and the total population in each county.
        By dividing the total number of people attending college or graduate school by the total
        population in the county, you'll get a choropleth that isn't skewed by counties that have much 
        larger populations. This ratio helps us compare the counties better and shows us which counties have 
        a higher proportion of people attending college or graduate school.</p>
