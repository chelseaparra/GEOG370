    <h1>Homework 8: Census Data Ratios and Categories</h1>

    <h2>Chelsea Parra</h2>
    <p>In order to normalize my data, I created a ratio using the total population of people
        attending college or graduate school in each county and the total population in each county.
        By dividing the total number of people attending college or graduate school by the total
        population in the county, you'll get a choropleth that isn't skewed by counties that have much 
        larger populations. This ratio helps us to compare the counties better and shows us which counties have 
        a higher proportion of people attending college or graduate school.</p> 

    <h2>Map 1: Classification Using Quantiles</h2>
    <p>For this map I used the ratio of people attending college or graduate school and the total population
        of people in the county. For classification I used quantiles or equal count classification. This method creates a choropleth
        that has more of an even distribution in color. This is because each group or interval is getting
        an equal number values. This also means each class is more evenly represented. The disadvantage 
        to this is that the classes can have big gaps between each other. So for example for this map 
        the fifth class represents 43-58 people, while the sixth class represents 58-260 people. This means
        the sixth category is a bit over-weighed. It can also show that some counties have a really high ratio 
        when in reality they might just fit into the higher class becasue it has such a wide range of values</p>

    <h2>Map 2: Classification Using Equal Interval</h2>
    <p>For this map I used the same ratio as before but using the equal interval classification.
        Looking at the map it's dominated by the lighter shade classes, with only one county of the darkest shade.
        This method makes it so that each class has an equal number of values and each range is the same. The 
        adavatage to this method is that the gaps between each class aren't as skewed. However, the disadvantage
        to this is that most of the counties fall into the lower classes leaving us with a very one-toned map.</p>

    <h2>Map 3: Classification Using Jenks Natural Breaks</h2>
    <p>For this map I represented the same ratio as before but used jenks natural breaks. This method
        uses natural classes or optimal ranges for each class. This method created a choropleth that was pretty
        much inbetween the last two maps. It does not have a dominance of light colors or smaller classes and also
        doesn't have that many dark colors. The advantage to this method is that it identifies real classes in the data.
        This means it will more accuratly represent the data than previous methods. I also believe this method
        beats out the others because the classes are farily well distributed and the classes are not heavily skewed.</p>
